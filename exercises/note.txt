> npx tsc (to compile typescript files)
tsconfig.json (ts compiler can be conigured in this file)

npm install -g typescript (to install typescript compiler globally)

typescript can infer the types in two ways:


two ways that ts will infer types:
// Explicit -> when you declare types
// Implicit -> when ts automatically determines the type

unknown type is for unknown types
any is for disabling type checking on that variable

unknown is safer than any

readonly can be used outside classes (i did not know that)
